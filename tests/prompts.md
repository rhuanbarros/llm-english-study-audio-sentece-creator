# Prompt 1
I'm studying english to get a machine learning job in a IT company. 
I will provide you with a CSV file with a list of sentences from a english book. 
I need you to change with sentence to a similiar sentence,but using vocabulary from another range of domain like work, meetings, machine learning, development, programming.

You should pay BIG ATENTION to the correct grammar.
Specialy to the correct verb to subject form in the case of singular and plural cases.
Example, if a sentence talk about a individual and the next sentence talk about the last sentence, the verb should singular if the subject of the last sentence was singular, etc.
Example:
2,Wizard-Lesson 1-01.wma,2, Did the boy pay $1 for the paper at the newsstand?
3,Wizard-Lesson 1-01.wma,3," Yes, he did. He paid $1 for the paper at the newsstand."


You should pay atention that some of the sentences talk about the same subject, so the next sentence verb should be singular if the subject of the last sentence was singular, and plural if the subject was plural. 


I need you to answer it in CSV format.
